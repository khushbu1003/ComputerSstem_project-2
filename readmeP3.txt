********************Process**********************
I have started this project a week before its due and i rewatched all lecture and used notes too

I was struggling so bad with using if /else statement in assembly language.

I tried to look at the ppt but couldnt find any hints 

however, I have tried using it under start 

My additon was working properly then i tried to add subtraction procedure and now only subtraction works.

#############################################################################################################################
*******************Special Instruction to run the project********************
After using nasm and ld command when you ./test
It will ask to enter operands
Then you can enter -/+
Then enter three times
and ask for digit 1
and ask for digit 2

This will get to the subtraction result.


however if you put + then enter three times 
and enter digits, it will print either \ or .
*****There is a possibility that you might get \ or . in the result for the first time
since i tried making changes to register but one second trial it should work***********
**************Things I should have done*****
I know the last time we have looked at how to use[] and increment and store it into the register
Maybe somewhere I didnt get the concept
